/**
 * Disk read-ahead for ExoPlayer (Nuvio Reshaped). Superfork G4d (feature 25): FILE_PORT of
 * DavidVamaiotu/NuvioTV-Reshaped @ 0ccf049 `seekbuffer/SeekReadAhead.kt`, engaged only by the Seek
 * optimized strategy, sized by [SeekOptimizedMedia.readAheadMb] and never on the parallel path
 * (D006). Adaptations: size passed in (no Reshaped settings screen), no Live TV registry, no
 * seek-bar or throughput-sampler hooks, leftover files removed on first use in the process.
 *
 * ExoPlayer's own buffer lives in memory and is capped by the device budget. Here one connection
 * reads the stream ahead of playback into a ring file of the chosen size and the player reads
 * from that file, so seeks anywhere inside it need no network. Parts behind playback are
 * overwritten: only what is coming up is kept.
 *
 * It stands in for the player's own connection rather than adding one: a read outside the ring
 * moves the read-ahead there, so the stream never has more than the read-ahead's connection
 * (debrid hosts allow one per link). It sits directly on the network source, under the optional
 * VOD disk cache, which keeps what was already played; the ring holds what comes next. The ring
 * is a temporary file, deleted when playback ends and at every launch.
