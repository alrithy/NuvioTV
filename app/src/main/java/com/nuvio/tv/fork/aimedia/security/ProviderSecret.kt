/**
 * Opaque holder for a provider secret (API key) owned by [ProviderCredentialVault].
 *
 * Hard rules enforced by this type:
 *  - there is no property, getter, `toString`, `equals` or `hashCode` output that
 *    exposes the plaintext bytes;
 *  - the bytes are only ever handed to the [use] callback as a defensive copy,
 *    which is zeroed after the callback returns (best-effort hygiene — the
 *    callback itself is trusted first-party code);
 *  - construction copies the caller's array defensively, so later mutation of
 *    the source array does not change the stored secret.
